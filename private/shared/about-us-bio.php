<p>Kuri Team was founded during semester 2020C at RMIT University Vietnam, Saigon South Campus. As a young organization, our goal is to support each other in our projects, academic success, and personal development. Our last study project is a game prototype, proposed by us in our assignment paper for COSC2083 - Introduction to IT, to be implemented into RMIT wi-fi network. More detail on that project and proposal to RMIT can be found <a href="https://miketvo.com/blog/project-idea-nov-2020.html">here</a>. The playable prototype can be accessed <a href="https://miketvo.com/project/rmit-sgs-network-game/game.html">here</a>.</p>
